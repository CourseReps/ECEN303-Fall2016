# Programming Challenges

Engineering students possess vastly different programming skills and experience.
Nevertheless, in today's world, every graduating engineering student should be proficient in multiple popular programming languages.
As such, this course includes basic Python exercises that focus on the fundamentals of probability.
Completing challenges only requires rudimentary programming skills, and it offers valuable insight into Random Signals and Systems.
Simple programs can be employed to assimilate concepts and check answers.
Using computers should become part of your tool set in solving engineering problems that involve probability.


## Submitting Programming Challenges

Every programming challenge is relatively straightforward and it should be contained in __one__ Python file.
This file should be labeled `Challenge?.py`, where `?`should be replaced by an appropriate number.
Pay special attention to uppercase and lowercase letters; the grading scripts may be case sensitive.
